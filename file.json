You might mention author signings.&#13; &#13; As a freelancer and ebook author, you might wonder how you can compete with such marketing clout. You hardly have the budget for a taxi to the airport, let alone for an airport billboard extravaganza.&#13; &#13; Yet if you look at it a little more deeply, you'll discover there's a lot more to promoting a book than posters and pizazz. Walk into a bookstore, and look at the books all around you, especially those on the promotional stands. Every book is where it is for a reason. Oftentimes, publishers pay bookstores to display certain books prominently.&#13; &#13; Even the books on the regular shelves are placed based on categories chosen by the publisher.&#13; &#13; All this counts as marketing, and in this aspect of marketing you're on a level pegging with the big players, even as a self published author.&#13; &#13; In this tutoria",
